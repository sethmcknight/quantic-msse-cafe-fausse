Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
Project: Café Fausse Website Development
1. Introduction

This document defines the requirements for the Café Fausse Web Application.
1.2 Scope
The Café Fausse Website is a responsive, full-stack web application that provides
information about the restaurant, displays the menu, allows customers to make table
reservations, and showcases awards and customer testimonials. The project will be
developed using React (with JSX) for the front-end, a Flask back-end, and a
PostgreSQL database for persistent data management.

The Café Fausse Web Application will serve as the digital front door for a fine-dining
establishment. It will combine a visually appealing React-based front-end with a robust
Flask back-end to handle table reservations and newsletter signup. A PostgreSQL
database will ensure reliable data storage for reservations and customer information.

    customer reviews.

management, and reservation oversight.
